        "description": "The U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), established in 2002 to coordinate climate and global change research conducted in the United States and to support decision-making on climate-related issues, is producing twenty-one synthesis and assessment reports that address its research, observation, and decision-support needs. The first report, produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in coordination with other agencies, focuses on understanding reported differences between independently produced data sets of temperature trends for the surface through the lower stratosphere and comparing these data sets to model simulations. To ensure credibility and quality, NOAA asked the National Research Council to conduct an independent review of the report. The committee concluded that the report Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere: Understanding and Reconciling Differences is a good first draft that covers an appropriate range of issues, but that it could be strengthened in a number of ways."

Computer programs that calculate magnetic and electric fields are considered, along with programs that calculate orbits of particles in a magnetic and/or electric field. Some representative programs useful in the design of linear accelerator-type cavities are also discussed. This book is comprised of six chapters and begins with a review of two-dimensional magnetostatic programs, including TRIM, LINDA, NUTCRACKER, MAREC, GRACY, and COILS. The University of Colorado's magnet program is also examined. The next chapter is devoted to programs capable of solving problems relating to the calculation of electrostatic fields in two-dimensional geometries. The reader is also introduced to programs that perform calculations of three-dimensional linear and nonlinear problems, along with programs that employ matrix formalism and integration of equations of motion. The final chapter looks at programs for linear accelerator-type cavities, including CURE, JESSY, MESSYMESH, and AZTEC. This monograph will be a useful resource for physical scientists, engineers, and computer programmers."

The Business Process Model and Notation based on BPMNTM 2 training introduces participants to the essence of the language. BPMN or Business Process Model and Notation is the standard for modeling business processes. Currently under the care of The Object Management Group® (OMG®), BPMN has had a checkered history which we believe reflects the complexity it seeks to standardise. Process models are much older than the kind of models that UML tried to standardize. These UML models often have a much more intimate relationship with software development. We can trace process models back to Frederick Winslow Taylor who was one of the first to attempt to look at production processes in a scientific way. This happened in the 19th century, at a time when people had unwavering faith in the ability of science (and technology) to solve all problems. Before you can proceed to control, improve or even innovate the processes of your organization, it is important to provide insight into the processes. How do you ensure that the knowledge of individuals comes together and is transferable and accessible to the entire organization? As a modeling language, BPMN offers a standard for communicating about business processes.

        "description": "The Apple Macintosh Encyclopedia provides easily accessible, brief and understandable information on the topics that you are most likely to have questions about. We have carefully digested the manuals, books, magazine articles, and other information sources for the Macintosh. These, combined with our own experience in using the Macintosh and other personal computers, have been integrated into an alphabetical sequence of short entries in the style of an encyclopedia. The goal is to provide concise, useful and easy-to-understand information on a particular topic that is quickly accessible when you need it. Much of the information in the entries is not contained in the manuals provided with the Macintosh and various software products. For example, notice the discussion, under WIDTH, of the \"deferred\" nature of this command when used with a device name, the discussion of the colon (:) in Multiplan for ranges, or Saving, Problems With. These topics are omitted or inadequately covered in the standard manuals. The Macintosh is the first truly visual computer. In keeping with the highly visual nature of using the Macintosh, we have provided over 100 illustrations. Each shows exactly what you will see on the screen when exploring topics discussed in the text. The Macintosh Encyclopedia opens with a visual guide to icons, and remains highly visual in orientation throughout the text."

        "description": "Demand side management (DSM) is one of the most topical issues in regulating electric utilities, both in the United States and internationally. What is DSM? It consists of various measures at the level of demand (households, commerce, industry, others), which are at least partially financed by electric utilities and which should either conserve energy or reduce the peak load. The practice of DSM originates from The Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 (PURPA) that provided the political and legal framework to set energy conservation as a national goal, which encouraged regulatory commissions to initiate utility conservation programs; see e.g., Nowell-Tschirhart (1990) and Fox-Penner (1990). Moreover, integrated resource planning, which must account for DSM on a level playing field with supply, is written into the 1992 Energy Policy Act as the U.S. Government's preferred method of electric power planning. Although PURPA set energy conservation as a national priority, its implementation was left to the states with the consequence of considerable differences concerning efforts and rules. By 1993 16 states had already implemented integrated resource planning, 9 were in the process of doing so and further 9 considered implementation, (EPRI 1993b). Due to the Clean Air Act of 1990, 24 states are considering to include external costs in integrated resource planning."

It belongs on the bookshelf of every leader and manager of a nonprofit organization ?Dennis R. Young, Mandel Professor of Nonprofit Management, and governing director, Mandel Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Case Western Reserve University Herman and his associates have created a book that organizes a complex topic in a sensible and accessible way. Nationally recognized experts expand the reader's perception well beyond narrow managerial issues, but the managerial meat is here, too. Whether for reference or teaching purposes, a better set of topics and authors on nonprofit leadership and management is difficult to imagine. ?Bradford H. Gray, executive director, Program on Non-Profit Organizations (PONPO), Yale University The leading experts in the nonprofit field describe effective practices in all the distinctive and important functions, processes, and strategies of nonprofit leadership and management. Based on up-to-date research, theory, and experience, this comprehensive volume offers practical advice on every aspect of managing nonprofit organizations, including board development, strategic planning, lobbying, marketing, government contracting, volunteer programs, fund raising, financial accounting, compensation and benefits programs, risk management, and much more."
