        "description": "The U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), established in 2002 to coordinate climate and global change research conducted in the United States and to support decision-making on climate-related issues, is producing twenty-one synthesis and assessment reports that address its research, observation, and decision-support needs. The first report, produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in coordination with other agencies, focuses on understanding reported differences between independently produced data sets of temperature trends for the surface through the lower stratosphere and comparing these data sets to model simulations. To ensure credibility and quality, NOAA asked the National Research Council to conduct an independent review of the report. The committee concluded that the report Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere: Understanding and Reconciling Differences is a good first draft that covers an appropriate range of issues, but that it could be strengthened in a number of ways.",

        "description": "Particle Accelerator Design: Computer Programs describes some of the most important computer programs applicable to the design of particle accelerators. Computer programs that calculate magnetic and electric fields are considered, along with programs that calculate orbits of particles in a magnetic and/or electric field. Some representative programs useful in the design of linear accelerator-type cavities are also discussed. This book is comprised of six chapters and begins with a review of two-dimensional magnetostatic programs, including TRIM, LINDA, NUTCRACKER, MAREC, GRACY, and COILS. The University of Colorado's magnet program is also examined. The next chapter is devoted to programs capable of solving problems relating to the calculation of electrostatic fields in two-dimensional geometries. The reader is also introduced to programs that perform calculations of three-dimensional linear and nonlinear problems, along with programs that employ matrix formalism and integration of equations of motion. The final chapter looks at programs for linear accelerator-type cavities, including CURE, JESSY, MESSYMESH, and AZTEC. This monograph will be a useful resource for physical scientists, engineers, and computer programmers.",

It belongs on the bookshelf of every leader and manager of a nonprofit organization ?Dennis R. Young, Mandel Professor of Nonprofit Management, and governing director, Mandel Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Case Western Reserve University Herman and his associates have created a book that organizes a complex topic in a sensible and accessible way. Nationally recognized experts expand the reader's perception well beyond narrow managerial issues, but the managerial meat is here, too. Whether for reference or teaching purposes, a better set of topics and authors on nonprofit leadership and management is difficult to imagine. ?Bradford H. Gray, executive director, Program on Non-Profit Organizations (PONPO), Yale University The leading experts in the nonprofit field describe effective practices in all the distinctive and important functions, processes, and strategies of nonprofit leadership and management. Based on up-to-date research, theory, and experience, this comprehensive volume offers practical advice on every aspect of managing nonprofit organizations, including board development, strategic planning, lobbying, marketing, government contracting, volunteer programs, fund raising, financial accounting, compensation and benefits programs, risk management, and much more.",

The 30 papers deal with the introduction of computer in schools in many countries around the world: Norway, South Africa, UK, Canada, Australia, USA, Finland, Chile, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Ireland, Israel and Poland. The authors are not professional historians but rather people who as teachers, students or researchers were involved in this history and they narrate their experiences from a personal perspective offering fascinating stories.",

        "description": "The future of computing ever-increasingly lies in ever-increasing mobility in which computers continue their network operations while physically changing their location, and code moves from system to system performing its designated tasks throughout a network. This book brings together in one single resource the leading edge of research and practice in three areas of mobility: process migration, mobile computing, and mobile agents. Presented chronologically, the papers in this book--each written by leading experts in that particular area--track the development of critical technologies that have influenced mobility. Introductions by the editors and original afterwords by many of the papers' authors provide information on implementation and practical application, technological context, and updates on the most recent advances. The book highlights many common challenges and solutions inherent in various aspects of mobility: infrastructure, scalability, security, standards, robustness, naming and locating mobile entities, and more. Individual papers describe specific research and development in each of the three major areas, covering such topics as: An analysis of process migration from the earliest work to contemporary commercial systems Barriers to effective mobile connectivity, mobile IP, and ubiquitous computing Descriptions of various mobile agent systems, such as Telescript, Aglets, Agent TCL, and the mobile agent system standard (MASIF) This selection of influential papers illustrates the evolution of mobile technology as well as the state of the art of one of the most significant trends in computing. 0201379287B04062001",

Over many years, thick client PC’s were the first choice in order to deploy a wide range of services and applications. So-called thick client (also known as “fat” client) devices are computationally capable and flexible. However, those thick clients became a target point of innumerable worms, viruses, and other malware attacks which results in information leaks and organizational discipline as well as considerable effort to maintain and centrally control. Therefore, many companies take the advantages of the thin client technology into consideration in order to address the challenges organizations face with thick clients.",

We show that under a wide set of circumstances the arrival of a new GPT that raises long-run output can trigger a recession in the short-run. Furthermore, we characterize features of the GPT that produce a cyclical adjustment path. An initial recession occurs whenever a higher education level is required to operate the new GPT. But a recession can also occur when the new GPT has lower educational requirements. A cyclical adjustment path is more likely when inexperienced workers are less productive with the new technology and the faster productivity rises with experience in the new sector.",

What benefits are on offer and what are the risks? What are the consequences for educational interventions? Putting Learning Before Technology! discusses these questions and more in a thorough exploration of the use of technology in educational settings. Central to the author's argument is that digitalization as a sole and structural measure will bring little benefit and that the teachers who bring lessons to life are much more important. Features of the book include: evidence from Visible Learning research to scientifically frame the effectiveness and pitfalls of technology in the classroom; real-life classroom examples; graphics to clearly illustrate key concepts and studies. This book is a fascinating analysis of the impact, possibilities, and limits of the use of technology within education, and will appeal to teachers and teacher-trainers in any setting or country.",

        "subtitle": "A History of Development in the Netherlands East Indies",
        "description": "Technology and Ethical Idealism investigates a pivotal intellectual and political moment in twentieth-century Indonesian history, the establishment of \"development\" as both an ideal and a practice. The focus of this study is on technological development as a central concern of colonial political life from 1900 to 1942 in the Netherlands East Indies. The foundations of developmentalist thinking and practice in the turn-of-the-century colonial reforms were called the Ethical policies. Tracing the interplay of Ethical politics at the highest levels of the Netherlands Indies colonial government with the technical practices of development taking place in the fields of ordinary Javanese farmers, it shows how and why technological development became such an enduring part of political and material life in the archipelago. This study offers a new history of the Ethical policies that focuses on their often-neglected technopolitical character, and the formative influence they exercised on development thinking in Indonesia among both Dutch experts and members of the community of Indonesian activists known as the pergerakan. In startling contrast with many histories of development, it shows how the interaction of colonial idealism and scientific practice led the Dutch to commit to small-scale change in their \"development of the native peoples.\" As experts tailored technical solutions to ecological, social, and economic conditions of local areas, they eschewed high modernism in their search for colonial moderni-zation, unexpectedly prefiguring the appropriate technology movements that arose decades later. Based on extensive research in the colonial archives in The Hague, the National Library in Jakarta, and the Bogor Library of Biology and Agriculture, this study draws on official documents and scientific research of the era, as well as public discussions in both Dutch and Indonesian language newspapers and journals in order to capture not just the official plans, but also a wide range of public critiques and responses to development, and the day-to-day practices that shaped the productive lives of ordinary farmers. Offering a new exploration of politics and technology in colonial Indonesia, this book will interest historians of Indonesia and Southeast Asia, historians of technology, and those seeking to understand the complex colonial roots of international development.",

        "description": "Scholars from communication and media studies join those from science and technology studies to examine media technologies as complex, sociomaterial phenomena. In recent years, scholarship around media technologies has finally shed the assumption that these technologies are separate from and powerfully determining of social life, looking at them instead as produced by and embedded in distinct social, cultural, and political practices. Communication and media scholars have increasingly taken theoretical perspectives originating in science and technology studies (STS), while some STS scholars interested in information technologies have linked their research to media studies inquiries into the symbolic dimensions of these tools. In this volume, scholars from both fields come together to advance this view of media technologies as complex sociomaterial phenomena. The contributors first address the relationship between materiality and mediation, considering such topics as the lived realities of network infrastructure. The contributors then highlight media technologies as always in motion, held together through the minute, unobserved work of many, including efforts to keep these technologies alive.

They each craft a roadmap for their sphere of development to 2050. In their entirety, the general and sub-group reports analyze the evolution and laws governing the development of science and technology, describe the decisive impact of science and technology on the modernization process, predict that the world is on the eve of an impending S&T revolution, and call for China to be fully prepared for this new round of S&T advancement. Based on the detailed study of the demands on S&T innovation in China’s modernization, the reports draw a framework for eight basic and strategic systems of socio-economic development with the support of science and technology, work out China’s S&T roadmaps for the relevant eight basic and strategic systems in line with China’s reality, further detail S&T initiatives of strategic importance to China’s modernization, and provide S&T decision-makers with comprehensive consultations for the development of S&T innovation consistent with China’s reality. Supported by illustrations and tables of data, the reports provide researchers, government officials and entrepreneurs with guidance concerning research directions, the planning process, and investment. Founded in 1949, the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the nation’s highest academic institution in natural sciences. Its major responsibilities are to conduct research in basic and technological sciences, to undertake nationwide integrated surveys on natural resources and ecological environment, to provide the country with scientific data and consultations for government’s decision-making, to undertake government-assigned projects with regard to key S&T problems in the process of socio-economic development, to initiate personnel training, and to promote China’s high-tech enterprises through its active engagement in these areas.",

        "description": "This book explores how information and communications technologies are adapted, governed, and reinterpreted in areas where the state has limited reach. The governance and regulation of new technologies, from social media to AI, has never seemed more urgent. Efforts to harness the potential benefits, to encourage innovation and novel applications, yet restrain the known and unknown harmful aspects of these technologies, have posed unprecedented challenges. This book brings together an eclectic collection of cases from around the world – from the favelas in Brazil to the border regions of Ethiopia and Somalia and to markets in Thailand – to tease out the broader arguments and logics about how diverse enabling environments for technology and innovation may evolve and the wide range of public authorities that may be involved in providing governance and security for such innovation, beyond the state. The term ‘the rule of non-law’ refers to the breadth and array of rules, norms, and systems that enable novel technological assemblages and uses. By looking at technologies and the rule of non-law in areas that are often seen as marginal or at the peripheries (from a profit and business perspective), this book reflects new insights back to more Western-dominated mainstream debates about law, technology, and innovation. This book will be of great interest to students of Socio-Legal Studies, Science and Technology Studies, Critical Security Studies, and International Relations.",

        "description": "Half a century into the digital era, the profound impact of information technology on intellectual and cultural life is universally acknowledged but still poorly understood. The sheer complexity of the technology coupled with the rapid pace of change makes it increasingly difficult to establish common ground and to promote thoughtful discussion. Responding to this challenge, Switching Codes brings together leading American and European scholars, scientists, and artists—including Charles Bernstein, Ian Foster, Bruno Latour, Alan Liu, and Richard Powers—to consider how the precipitous growth of digital information and its associated technologies are transforming the ways we think and act. Employing a wide range of forms, including essay, dialogue, short fiction, and game design, this book aims to model and foster discussion between IT specialists, who typically have scant training in the humanities or traditional arts, and scholars and artists, who often understand little about the technologies that are so radically transforming their fields. Switching Codes will be an indispensable volume for anyone seeking to understand the impact of digital technology on contemporary culture, including scientists, educators, policymakers, and artists, alike.",

The innovative blend of tasks and technology in technology-mediated communication is guided by task-based language teaching and learning principles, and the contexts of study span adult college-level education settings in the United States, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Malaysia. The volume opens up a new framework that the authors call “technology-mediated TBLT,” in which tasks and technology are genuinely and productively integrated in the curriculum according to learning-by-doing philosophies of language pedagogy, new language education needs, and digital technology realities.",

        "description": "Imagination is highly valued and sought-after, yet elusive and ill-defined. Definitions range from narrowly cognitive accounts to those which endow imagination with world-making powers. Imagination underpins our ability to speculate about the future and to re-experience the past. The everyday functioning of society relies on being able to imagine the perspectives of others; and our sense of who we are depends on the stories our imaginations create. Our soaring imaginations have taken us to the moon and allowed Einstein to race a light beam. Unsurprisingly, imagination underlies every aspect of human-computer interaction, from the earliest conceptual sketches, through the realistic possibilities portrayed variously in well-known tools as scenarios and storyboards, through to the wilder shores of design fictions. Yet, curiously, imagination is very rarely addressed directly in the design and HCI literature (and is wholly missing from virtual reality). This book addresses this gap in our accounts of how we imagine, conceptualise, design and use digital technologies. Drawing on many years of practical and academic experience in human computer-interaction, together with a wide range of material from psychology, design, cognitive science and HCI, seasoned with a little philosophy and anthropology, Imagination + Technology first considers imagination itself and the principal farthings of a new account. Later chapters discuss the role of imagination in the design, aesthetics, use and experience of digital technologies before the concluding chapter focusses on the provocative nature of imagination. The book will be stimulating reading for anyone working in the field of interactive technology and related areas, whether academics, students or practitioners.",

Fortunately, deploying new technology has never been easier, primarily due to early maturity and cloud delivery. One approach that is helping companies rapidly pilot and affordably deploy new technologies is ready technology, a new category of information technology (IT). This book explains the ready technology adoption process in detail, enabling companies to exploit new technology immediately and effectively. In this book, the author challenges the traditional \"requirements-first/technology-second\" approach to technology deployment. Espousing a \"technology-first/requirements-second\" approach, the author explains how business solutions are \"discovered\" by deploying—not studying—ready technology. The book covers the latest trends and processes in ready technology. It also describes the characteristics of ready companies and recommends ready technology pilots that should be launched by the following industries: higher education, retail, and healthcare.",

The authors -- representing government, business, and university sectors -- helped to set the boundaries of present technology assessment by offering perspectives from computer science, cognitive and military psychology, and education. Their work explores both the use of techniques to assess technology and the use of technology to facilitate the assessment process. The book's main purpose is to portray the state of the art in technology assessment and to provide conceptual options to help readers understand the power of technology. Technological innovation will continue to develop its own standards of practice and effectiveness. To the extent that these practices are empirically based, designers, supporters, and consumers will be given better information for their decisions.",

        "description": "The modern world is filled with debate and controversy, and science and technology—the most characteristic features of the modern world—are not immune. Science and technology are implicated in many if not all of the issues, troubles, and problems students are likely to come across in their classes and in their everyday lives. Science and technology serve as a primary pathway to understanding front page headlines on everything from war to AIDS, and from oil exploration to global warming. Battleground: Science and Technology examines the most hot-button issues involving science and technology and provides a balanced assessment of the arguments on all sides of the often strident debates. The approximately 100 issues examined in Battleground: Science and Technology include topics in the brain sciences, including the controversies over the cause of autism and the reliability of memory, as well as the debates over parapsychology; debates surrounding information technology, such as only privacy, the impact of video games on social behavior, and the advent of virtual reality; the complexity over drugs and medications, such as the testing of the efficacy of medications, the war on recreational drugs, and the costs of pharmaceutical research; and hot-button topics that are constantly in the news, such as evolution and creationism, DNA testing, stem-cell research, and genetically modified organisms. Each entry provides a list of accessible resources useful for further research.",

It first explores theoretical basis of climate change-related technology transfer, with a particular focus on the differences between climate technology transfer and business-as-usual performance. The book then reviews practices of both technology supplier and user, in order to generally identify potential legal barriers and obstacles. Finally, it sheds light on China, providing a comprehensive assessment on barriers that hinder the trans-boundary transfers of low carbon technologies and need to be overcome in future. The issues concerned involve two of the most dynamic areas in current China’s lawmaking progress: environment laws and Intellectual Property laws. The book provides an in-depth analysis on China’s legislation and practices in this regard. At international level, the legal framework of climate technology transfer is examined in a systematic, prudent and constructive manner. On this basis, the book highlights potential commons, consistency and possible coordination between the UNFCCC and the WTO regime. This book is accessible to both Chinese and international environmental law specialists. It appeals to a broad readership, including environmental scientists, economists concerned with China’s intellectual property law, foreign investment law and anyone interested in the topic: how to green intellectual property rights regime for climate technology transfer in the China context.",

        "description": "This Handbook provides a comprehensive and international representation of state-of-the art research, theory, and practice related to principal areas in which significant developments are occurring in the study of literacy and technology. It offers a glimpse of the commonalities faced by literacy educators around the world, together with specific challenges raised by unique circumstances. Volume I of this Handbook endeavored to lay essential groundwork for the study of literacy and technology; it retains an explanatory value that will not weaken over time. Volume II differs considerably in conception. It assumes for the most part a higher level of expertise on the part of readers, and the projects and applications described by the contributors are characterized by greater sophistication. The scope of technology use is broader, and the challenges that have emerged are in sharper focus. A powerful feature of this volume is the addition of commentaries from experts across the field on the potential of technology in key dimensions of literacy. The title of Volume II has changed slightly to reflect the inclusion of contributions on a broad geographic basis. It is now a truly international Handbook, with chapter authors from six countries and five continents. The International Handbook of Literacy and Technology: Volume II is organized in five sections: *The Role of Technology in the New Literacies; *Technology Applications with Specific Populations; *Literacy Software and the Internet; *Teacher Education and Professional Development; and *The Potential of Technology in Key Dimensions of Literacy. The effects of technology on literate activity have been both sweeping and subtle, marked by an increasing variety of changes that are difficult to evaluate and project. Perhaps the only prediction that can be offered with certainty is that the impact of technology is irreversible. Specific changes may come and go, but literacy and technology seem inextricably linked. This Handbook is dedicated to that linkage and to examining the intricacies that define it. International Handbook of Literacy and Technology: Volume II is an essential reference for researchers, professionals, and students in reading/literacy education, literacy and technology, educational technology, and related areas, and will serve well as a text for upper-level and graduate courses on these topics.",

The Council (while not necessarily endorsing this book) suggested that a wider audience could be interested in the type of material contained in my report and kindly gave me permission to publish the material in my own right. The present book contains this and other material, some of which was presented at a seminar on National Science Policy: Implications for Government Departments arranged by the Department of Science and the Environment. Additional ideas were developed in response to comments on the manuscript by referees, as a result of discussions with Professor John Metcalfe and Dr Peter Stubbs of Manchester University, a conversation with Dr Keith Hartley of the University of York and in the wake of a communication from Dr Ken Tucker, Assistant Director, Bureau of Industry Economics, Australia. Science and technology policy affects and concerns everyone of us if for no other reason than we cannot escape in this interdependent world from the economic, social and environmental overs pills generated by science and technology. We must face the problems and promises inherent in new and existing science and technology whether we like it or not. Not surprisingly this book finds that all industrialized countries seem to be facing similar economic and social problems.",

        "description": "\"A group of remarkably penetrating, frank, and expert scientists, techno-wizards, activists, and writers raise provocative questions about what is gained and what is lost in a world enthralled by technology in this wonderfully soulful forum on life in the 'Wired World.'\" -BOOKLIST Biotechnology, Cloning, Robotics, Nanotechnology... At a time when scientific and technological breakthroughs keep our eyes focused on the latest software upgrades or the newest cell-phone wizardry, a group of today's most innovative thinkers are looking beyond the horizon to explore both the promise and the peril of our technological future. Human ingenuity has granted us a world of unprecedented personal power -- enabling us to communicate instantaneously with anyone anywhere on the globe, to transport ourselves in both real and virtual worlds to distant places with ease, to fill our bellies with engineered commodities once available to only a privileged elite. Through our technologies, we have sought to free ourselves from the shackles of nature and become its master. Yet science and technology continually transform our experience and society in ways that often seem to be beyond our control. Today, different areas of research and innovation are advancing synergistically, multiplying the rate and magnitude of technological and societal change, with consequences that no one can predict. Living with the Genie explores the origins, nature, and meaning of such change, and our capacity to govern it. As the power of technology continues to accelerate, who, this book asks, will be the master of whom? In Living with the Genie, leading writers and thinkers come together to confront thisquestion from many perspectives, including: Richard Powers's whimsical investigation of the limits of artificial intelligence; Philip Kitcher's confrontation of the moral implications of science; Richard Rhodes's exploration of the role of technology in reducing violence; Shiv Visvanathan's analysis of technology's genocidal potential; Lori Andrews's insights into the quest for human genetic enhancement; Alan Lightman's reflections on how technology changes the experience of our humanness. These and ten other provocative essays open the door to a new dialogue on how, in the quest for human mastery, technology may be changing what it means to be human, in ways we scarcely comprehend.",

Though packaging has to perform functions such as product protection and preservation, it is now being accepted as a value addition process. This compact textbook is designed primarily for the undergraduate students of printing technology and mechanical engineering. The text introduces the concepts and techniques relevant to packaging of industrial, pharmaceutical and food products. It covers the package design concepts with emphasis on graphics and colours, as innovation in packaging is taking place at a rapid pace due to the competition among brands for shelf appeal and space. Besides, it also discusses importance of glass as a packaging material, label types and their design, bulk packaging and test procedures on package to evaluate its worthiness in distribution and storage. In the second edition, the book has been updated wherever necessary. Chapter 7 on “Plastics and Speciality Packaging” has been completely overhauled and split to introduce a new chapter on “Package Finishing and Security (Chapter 8). Thus, in contrast to eight chapters of the previous edition, the book now comprises total nine chapters. Besides undergraduate students, this book will also be useful for diploma students of packaging, researchers and professionals in printing and packaging field. Key Features • A Case Study lends a practical orientation towards the subject of study. • Review questions, arranged in a graded manner, sharpen the analytical skills of the students. • Solved problems reinforce the understanding of the subject.",

        "description": "New York City College of Technology, known today as City Tech, traces its earliest roots to the trade school movement, which was supported by both organized labor and industry. Opening in February 1947 as the New York State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences, the school served the needs of returning GIs and others in need of employment training. City Tech trained United States Air Force personnel in its employment-oriented programs, including the first college-based program in the country in restorative dentistry. City Tech became the first public community college in New York, and in 1981, it became the senior college of technology of The City University of New York. Today City Tech is the largest public college of technology in the Northeast and the most diverse. New York City College of Technology highlights the history of this vibrant institution that has continually served the needs of both its students and its city.",

        "description": "Proven strategies for reforming STEM education in America’s schools, colleges, and universities. One study after another shows American students ranking behind their international counterparts in the STEM fields—science, technology, engineering, and math. Businesspeople and cultural critics such as Bill Gates warn that this alarming situation puts the United States at a serious disadvantage in the high-tech global marketplace of the twenty-first century, and President Obama places improvement in these areas at the center of his educational reform. What can be done to reverse this poor performance and to unleash America’s wasted talent? David E. Drew has good news—and the tools America needs to keep competitive. Drawing on both academic literature and his own rich experience, Drew identifies proven strategies for reforming America’s schools, colleges, and universities, and his comprehensive review of STEM education in the United States offers a positive blueprint for the future. These research-based strategies include creative and successful methods for building strong programs in science and mathematics education and show how the achievement gap between majority and minority students can be closed. A crucial measure, he argues, is recruiting, educating, supporting, and respecting America’s teachers. Accessible, engaging, and hard hitting, STEM the Tide is a clarion call to policymakers, administrators, educators, and everyone else concerned about students’ participation in the STEM fields and America’s competitive global position.",

        "description": "The current economic theory of innovation mainly analyses the technology factor and its impact on economic growth. In today's world, growth in information technology and knowledge of new ideas has altered the business paradigm dramatically. Modern economies have undergone a dynamic shift from material manufacturing to a new information technology model with research and development (R&D) and human capital. Through information and communications technology efficient information usage has achieved substantial productivity gains through learning by doing and incremental innovations. The present volume discusses this new paradigm in terms of both theory and industry applications, including Schumpeter in his innovation model and the emphasis on new innovations replacing the old. Growth of business networking and R&D consortium have dramatically helped the modern business to reduce their unit costs and improve efficiency. This volume presents some new models emphasizing knowledge sharing and R&D cooperation. Rapid growth in recent times in some south Asian countries have been cited as growth miracles are largely caused by knowledge spillover and learning by doing, and this volume also investigates the role of incremental innovations. With a strong focus and extension of the current theory of innovation and industry growth experiences of both the US and Asian countries, this book will be of interest to MBA and graduate students in economics, innovation management, and applied industrial economics.",

Postphenomenology presents a unique blend of insights from the philosophical traditions of phenomenology and American pragmatism, and applies them to studies of user relations to technologies. These studies provide deep descriptions of the ways technologies transform our abilities, augment our experience, and shape the world around us. This book proceeds with a preface by Don Ihde, postphenomenology's founder, and a detailed review of the main ideas of this perspective by the editors Robert Rosenberger and Peter-Paul Verbeek. The body of this volume is composed of twelve postphenomenological essays which reflect the expansive range, detail-orientation, and interdisciplinarity of this school of thought. These essays confront a broad assortment of topics, both abstract and concrete. Abstract topics addressed include metaphysics, ethics, methodology, and analysis of the notions of selfhood, skill training, speed, and political activism. Just a few of the concrete topics studied include human-like interactive robots, ethics education, image interpretation in radiology, science fiction tropes, transportation history, wearable computing, and organ donation protocols for brain-dead bodies. The volume concludes with constructive critiques of postphenomenology by Andrew Feenberg, Diane Michelfelder, and Albert Borgmann, all figures whose work is relevant to postphenomenological projects.",

When a number of these nodes work together, conceivably up to hundreds of thousands, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is formed. Research in the area of wireless sensor networks has become increasingly wid- pread in recent years, partly due to their wide range of potential uses and also partly due to the fact that the technology enabling such networks is now widely available from many di?erent suppliers, such as: Crossbow, MoteIV, Intel and SUN (java based motes). These wireless sensor networks have the potential to allow a level of integration between computers and the physical world that, to date, has been virtually impos- ble. The uses for such networks is almost limitless and include such diverse app- cations as a counter sniper system for urban warfare [1] tracking the path of a forest re [2], determining the structural stability of a building after an earthquake [3], or tracking people or objects inside a building [4], etc.",

        "description": "The first book to explain why blockchain technology will fundamentally change the Internet, what it does, and how we use it Over the past 30 years, no theorist of the digital age has better explained the next big thing than Don Tapscott. For example, in Wikinomics, Tapscott was the first to show how the Internet provides the first global platform for mass collaboration. Now, he writes about a profound technological shift that will change how the world does business--and everything else--using blockchain technology, which powers the digital currency Bitcoin. The Internet as we know it is great for collaboration and communication, but is deeply flawed when it comes to commerce and privacy. The new blockchain technology facilitates peer-to-peer transactions without any intermediary such as a bank or governing body. Keeping the user's information anonymous, the blockchain validates and keeps a permanent public record of all transactions. That means that your personal information is private and secure, while all activity is transparent and incorruptible--reconciled by mass collaboration and stored in code on a digital ledger. With its advent, we will not need to trust one another in the traditional sense, because trust is built into the system itself. Although many opportunities for the blockchain require a digital currency, Bitcoin is only one application of this great innovation in computer science. The blockchain can hold any legal document, from deeds and marriage licences to educational degrees and birth certificates. Call it the World Wide Ledger. It enables smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations, decentralized government services, and transactions among things. The Internet of Everything needs a Ledger of Everything: the blockchain is a truly open, distributed, global platform that fundamentally changes what we can do online, how we do it, and who can participate. Tapscott, writing with his son Alex, a financial analyst and technologist, argues that the blockchain will shape the next era of prosperity--in finance, business, healthcare, education, governance, and beyond.",

For this reason and because the amount of protein produced by soybeans per unit area of land is higher than that of any other crop, this little old bean has been called \"yellow jewel,\" \"great treasure,\" \"nature's miracle protein,\" and \"meat of the field. \" Now this bean is seen by some as a weapon against world hunger and a protein of the future. Most recently, the soybean has been touted as a possible weapon against chronic diseases. Since large-scale introduction to the Western world at the beginning of the twentieth century, the cultivation and use of soybeans have undergone a dramatic revolution: from traditional soyfoods in the Orient to a new generation of soyfoods in the West, from animal feed to value-added food protein ingredients, from industrial paints to affordable table oils and spreads, from an old field crop to a new crop with wide regions of adoptability, herbicide tolerance, pest resistance, and/or altered chemical composition, and from limited regional cultivation to expanded worldwide production.",

The traditional approaches focused mainly content and methodology from a teacher- centered point of view, ignoring crucial student factors which profoundly affect his performance. Teachers and educational authorities were dismayed and puzzled to find students performing poorly in spite of good methods and content. This led to the search and study of other factors that influence the student's learning and performance and a lot of research work was undertaken in this direction.",

        "description": "The performance of high-speed semiconductor devices—the genius driving digital computers, advanced electronic systems for digital signal processing, telecommunication systems, and optoelectronics—is inextricably linked to the unique physical and electrical properties of gallium arsenide. Once viewed as a novel alternative to silicon, gallium arsenide has swiftly moved into the forefront of the leading high-tech industries as an irreplaceable material in component fabrication. GaAs High-Speed Devices provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-science look at the phenomenally expansive range of engineering devices gallium arsenide has made possible—as well as the fabrication methods, operating principles, device models, novel device designs, and the material properties and physics of GaAs that are so keenly integral to their success. In a clear five-part format, the book systematically examines each of these aspects of GaAs device technology, forming the first authoritative study to consider so many important aspects at once and in such detail. Beginning with chapter 2 of part one, the book discusses such basic subjects as gallium arsenide materials and crystal properties, electron energy band structures, hole and electron transport, crystal growth of GaAs from the melt and defect density analysis. Part two describes the fabrication process of gallium arsenide devices and integrated circuits, shedding light, in chapter 3, on epitaxial growth processes, molecular beam epitaxy, and metal organic chemical vapor deposition techniques. Chapter 4 provides an introduction to wafer cleaning techniques and environment control, wet etching methods and chemicals, and dry etching systems, including reactive ion etching, focused ion beam, and laser assisted methods. Chapter 5 provides a clear overview of photolithography and nonoptical lithography techniques that include electron beam, x-ray, and ion beam lithography systems. The advances in fabrication techniques described in previous chapters necessitate an examination of low-dimension device physics, which is carried on in detail in chapter 6 of part three. Part four includes a discussion of innovative device design and operating principles which deepens and elaborates the ideas introduced in chapter 1. Key areas such as metal-semiconductor contact systems, Schottky Barrier and ohmic contact formation and reliability studies are examined in chapter 7. A detailed discussion of metal semiconductor field-effect transistors, the fabrication technology, and models and parameter extraction for device analyses occurs in chapter 8. The fifth part of the book progresses to an up-to-date discussion of heterostructure field-effect (HEMT in chapter 9), potential-effect (HBT in chapter 10), and quantum-effect devices (chapters 11 and 12), all of which are certain to have a major impact on high-speed integrated circuits and optoelectronic integrated circuit (OEIC) applications. Every facet of GaAs device technology is placed firmly in a historical context, allowing readers to see instantly the significant developmental changes that have shaped it. Featuring a look at devices still under development and device structures not yet found in the literature, GaAs High-Speed Devices also provides a valuable glimpse into the newest innovations at the center of the latest GaAs technology. An essential text for electrical engineers, materials scientists, physicists, and students, GaAs High-Speed Devices offers the first comprehensive and up-to-date look at these formidable 21st century tools. The unique physical and electrical properties of gallium arsenide has revolutionized the hardware essential to digital computers, advanced electronic systems for digital signal processing, telecommunication systems, and optoelectronics. GaAs High-Speed Devices provides the first fully comprehensive look at the enormous range of engineering devices gallium arsenide has made possible as well as the backbone of the technology—ication methods, operating principles, and the materials properties and physics of GaAs—device models and novel device designs. Featuring a clear, six-part format, the book covers: GaAs materials and crystal properties Fabrication processes of GaAs devices and integrated circuits Electron beam, x-ray, and ion beam lithography systems Metal-semiconductor contact systems Heterostructure field-effect, potential-effect, and quantum-effect devices GaAs Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuits and Digital Integrated Circuits In addition, this comprehensive volume places every facet of the technology in an historical context and gives readers an unusual glimpse at devices still under development and device structures not yet found in the literature.",

In this volume a number of international scholars consider this process and whether it has merely been a question of the law adapting to technology or whether technology has been forced to adapt to law. Technologies have wrought a culture shift it is therefore apposite to ask whether legal concepts, as reflections of culture, should also change.

In Technology and Public Management, Second Edition, author Alan Shark informs, engages, and directs students to consider best practices, with new material on emerging tech, data management and analytics, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. This thoroughly updated second edition explores: A broad range of technologies that government, nonprofit partners, and citizens depend upon to deliver important infrastructure, including security, education, public health and personal healthcare, transit and transportation, culture and commerce, to name a few. Growing mistrust in government, and the role technology can play in ameliorating it. Emerging and adapted technologies to help government achieve ambitious goals, including drawing carbon out of the atmosphere, empowering students everywhere to learn effectively at home or at school, improving healthcare, providing affordable housing, enabling agriculture to keep pace with population growth, and improving scores of other public services. The critical insights and management skills needed to argue for investments in information technology as necessary priorities for our public organizations to improve public services and resources. Reader-friendly and jargon-free, this textbook is required reading for students enrolled in public administration and nonprofit management programs, as well as for practicing public administrators looking for a better understanding of how technology may be successfully and responsibly used in public organizations.

The development of Nevada's Yucca Mountain into a repository for nuclear waste. The extensive irrigation networks of the Grand Coulee and Kuibyshev Dams. On the face of it, these massive projects are wonders of engineering, financial prowess, and our seldom-questioned ability to modify nature to suit our immediate needs. For nearly a century we have relied increasingly on science and technology to harness natural forces, but at what environmental and social cost? In Industrialized Nature, historian Paul R. Josephson provides an original examination of the ways in which science, engineering, policy, finance, and hubris have come together, often with unforeseen consequences, to perpetuate what he calls \"brute-force technologies\"—the large-scale systems created to manage water, forest, and fish resources. Throughout the twentieth century, nations with quite different political systems and economic orientations all pursued this same technological subjugation of nature. Josephson compares the Soviet Union's heavy-handed efforts at resource management to similar projects undertaken in the United States, Norway, Brazil, and China. He argues that brute-force technologies require brute-force politics to operate. He shows how irresponsible—or well-intentioned but misguided—large-scale manipulation of nature has resulted in resource loss and severe environmental degradation. Josephson explores the ongoing industrialization of nature that is happening in our own backyards and around the world. Both a cautionary tale and a call to action, Industrialized Nature urges us to consider how to develop a future for succeeding generations that avoids the pitfalls of brute-force technologies.",

America was to be the example of what humanity could be. Was that really achieved? The Greatest Transition in Human History tells the real story of America over the past over 200 years - the heartbreak, false-flag wars, hidden technology, power, corruption, and manipulation. Does the American citizen have real Freedom as the great Constitution and Bill of Rights intended? The Greatest Transition in Human History is the real emotion story of great Americans and patriots standing up for these great rights. These freedoms were taken for granted by so many - for many fell asleep and did not participate as much as we should have, including myself for many years. No more, for I work for humanity, and freedom. I want that real Freedom Bell to ring for all. For in the oath to a military person sworn in to our armed forces, they are to fight any enemy both foreign and domestic. The Greatest Transition in Human History is the story of brave people standing up for individual freedoms and rights worldwide, in the Greatest Secret War ever.",

Anders' philosophy has become increasingly prescient in our digitised, technological age as his work predicts the prevalence of social media, ubiquitous surveillance and the turn to big data. Anders' ouevre also explored the technologies of nuclear power and the biotech concerns for the human and transhuman condition which have become so central to current theory. Babette Babich argues that Anders offers important resources on streaming digital media through his writings on radio, television and film and is, unusually, both a comprehensive and profound thinker. Anders' relationship with key philosophers like Hannah Arendt and Walter Benjamin and his thinking on Goethe, Nietzsche and Rilke is also explored with a focus on the deep impact he made on his peers. It reflects specifically on the intersection of Anders' thought Heidegger and the Frankfurt school and how influential a figure he was on the landscape of 20th century philosophy. A compelling rehabilitation of a thinker with profound contemporary relevance.",

He reveals the modern origins of the epistemological configuration of nature, where a subject confronts an object in space (and at time t), and wonders about her mode of access to that object. After critiquing the spatial orientation of this concept of nature, Altamirano shows that a new concept of time is necessary to reinstall the subject within its concrete ecology. Altamirano goes on to deploy conceptual resources excavated from Deleuze, Guattari, Foucault and Leroi-Gourhan to show how technology, which bypasses the nature-artifice distinction, is an essential dimension of the philosophy of nature. Ultimately, this book draws the profile of a concept of nature based on time and technology that escapes the nature-artifice distinction that has mired the philosophy of nature for so long.",

        "description": "The invention of the laser was one of the towering achievements of the twentieth century. At the opening of the twenty-first century we are witnessing the burgeoning of the myriad technical innovations to which that invention has led. The Handbook of Laser Technology and Applications is a practical and long-lasting reference source for scientists and engineers who work with lasers. The Handbook provides, in a single work, a comprehensive guide to the current status of lasers and laser systems; it is accessible to science or engineering graduates needing no more than standard undergraduate knowledge of optics. Whilst being a self-contained reference work, the Handbook provides extensive references to contemporary work, and is a basis for studying the professional journal literature on the subject. It covers applications through detailed case studies, and is therefore well suited to readers who wish to use it to solve specific problems of their own. The first of the three volumes comprises an introduction to the basic scientific principles of lasers, laser beams and non-linear optics. The second volume describes the mechanisms and operating characteristics of specific types of laser including crystalline solid - state lasers, semiconductor diode lasers, fibre lasers, gas lasers, chemical lasers, dye lasers and many others as well as detailing the optical and electronic components which tailor the laser's performance and beam delivery systems. The third volume is devoted to case studies of applications in a wide range of subjects including materials processing, optical measurement techniques, medicine, telecommunications, data storage, spectroscopy, earth sciences and astronomy, and plasma fusion research. This vast compendium of knowledge on laser science and technology is the work of over 130 international experts, many of whom are recognised as the world leaders in their respective fields.. Whether the reader is engaged in the science, technology, industrial or medical applications of lasers or is researching the subject as a manager or investor in technical enterprises they cannot fail to be informed and enlightened by the wide range of information the Handbook supplies.",

        "description": "Control health care costs with these cost-effective, technology-based prevention/intervention techniques! In 2001, Americans spent $1.4 trillion on health care services. By 2010, health care costs are forecasted to approach 20% of the United States’ Gross National Product. Technology Applications in Prevention highlights much-needed technology-based prevention/intervention methods that can help contain health costs. “Efficient and Effective Uses of Technology in Community Research” provides the information that future prevention researchers and program evaluators will need to be effective in electronic data collection, management, and cost analysis. “Community Building with Technology: The Development of Collaborative Community Technology Initiatives” presents a case example showing how Web sites can function as regional clearinghouses of useful information and provide convenient forums where agency staff can update their prevention skills. “Applying Web-Based Survey Design Standards” addresses a question critical to professionals in e-data collection: How reliable is Web-based needs assessment and/or outcome data? This chapter suggests standards that should be adhered to in Internet-based data collection. “Assessing Quality Assurance of Self-Help Sites on the Internet” and “The Quality of Spanish Health Information Web Sites: An Emerging Disparity” address the current lack of quality in the health and mental health information available on the World Wide Web. “A Participatory Internet Initiative in an African-American Neighborhood” explores health disparity concerns regarding the use of the Internet. This chapter discusses several ways to empower those who are on the dark side of the “digital divide”—and shows how to ensure that Web-based material is culturally relevant and appropriate for those it is intended to help. “Alcohol Abuse Prevention Among High-Risk Youth” presents a case example of a life-skills based CD-ROM intervention designed to discourage kids from abusing alcohol. “Constructing Better Futures Via Video” looks at video-based futures planning, which combines self-modeling and “feedforward” to forecast a student’s future capabilities. This technique helps teenagers find meaning in their current educational setting and prepare for adulthood. This chapter also explains how to train school-based personnel to encourage positive attitudes and support the life skills of their students via carefully planned and edited—yet inexpensive—video productions. Why is the information in this book so essential? In 2000, approximately 20% of U.S. employers changed their health insurance plans as a cost savings strategy. American companies and their employees must new deal with new insurance plans that have reduced the breadth of their coverage and/or increased employee deductibles. The need for cost-effective preventive strategies is becoming increasingly more urgent as employers and insurance companies scramble to provide affordable health care coverage. New technologies have opened the door to better, more economical modes of preventive care. This book presents a vital cross-section of the current state of the art in the application of technology to prevention and intervention. Make it a part of your professional/teaching collection today!",

Carbon dioxide is released by chemical reactions that are employed to extract energy from fuels, and any regulatory policy limiting the amount of CO2 that could be released from sequestered sources or from energy-generating reactions will require substantial involvement of the chemical sciences and technology R&D community. Much of the public debate has been focused on the question of whether global climate change is occurring and, if so, whether it is anthropogenic, but these questions were outside the scope of the workshop, which instead focused on the question of how to respond to a possible national policy of carbon management. Previous discussion of the latter topic has focused on technological, economic, and ecological aspects and on earth science challenges, but the fundamental science has received little attention. This workshop was designed to gather information that could inform the Chemical Sciences Roundtable in its discussions of possible roles that the chemical sciences community might play in identifying and addressing underlying chemical questions.",

        "description": "Traditional music education centered around the ensemble classroom has often privileged reading music and instrumental technique over creative skills such as composition, improvisation, and learning by ear. As the technological landscape of students' everyday lives rapidly shifts, what schools teach rarely aligns with students' more creative day-to-day lives outside of the classroom. While administrators and state education standards often encourage incorporating creative technologies into the music curriculum, many music teachers lack the training to successfully utilize these tools and platforms. In Technology for Unleashing Creativity, author Steve Giddings provides a practical and easily accessible resource for in-service and pre-service K-12 teachers looking to make better use of technology in their teaching and help heighten students' creativity. One of few authors to tackle both issues simultaneously, Giddings offers a guide for inspiring creativity in students through tools like YouTube learning, notation technology, DAWs, electronic instruments, online pedagogical platforms, and more. A technology-driven approach to music education has never been timelier. COVID-19 has significantly disrupted the business-as-usual of educational institutions, and music educators especially have adapted to teaching remotely. Via practical tips, visual diagrams, and lesson plan ideas, Technology for Unleashing Creativity walks music teachers through the core aspects of using technology in their classrooms--in-person and remote--offering a definitive guide to creativity and technology in K-12 music education.",

        "description": "A wide-ranging and practical handbook that offers comprehensive treatment of high-pressure common rail technology for students and professionals In this volume, Dr. Ouyang and his colleagues answer the need for a comprehensive examination of high-pressure common rail systems for electronic fuel injection technology, a crucial element in the optimization of diesel engine efficiency and emissions. The text begins with an overview of common rail systems today, including a look back at their progress since the 1970s and an examination of recent advances in the field. It then provides a thorough grounding in the design and assembly of common rail systems with an emphasis on key aspects of their design and assembly as well as notable technological innovations. This includes discussion of advancements in dual pressure common rail systems and the increasingly influential role of Electronic Control Unit (ECU) technology in fuel injector systems. The authors conclude with a look towards the development of a new type of common rail system. Throughout the volume, concepts are illustrated using extensive research, experimental studies and simulations. Topics covered include: Comprehensive detailing of common rail system elements, elementary enough for newcomers and thorough enough to act as a useful reference for professionals Basic and simulation models of common rail systems, including extensive instruction on performing simulations and analyzing key performance parameters Examination of the design and testing of next-generation twin common rail systems, including applications for marine diesel engines Discussion of current trends in industry research as well as areas requiring further study Common Rail Fuel Injection Technology is the ideal handbook for students and professionals working in advanced automotive engineering, particularly researchers and engineers focused on the design of internal combustion engines and advanced fuel injection technology. Wide-ranging research and ample examples of practical applications will make this a valuable resource both in education and private industry.",

        "description": "This book provides descriptions and illustrations of cutting-edge text analysis methods for communication and marketing research; cultural, historical-comparative, and event analysis; curriculum evaluation; psychological diagnosis; language development research; and for any research in which statistical inferences are drawn from samples of texts. Although the book is accessible to readers having no experience with content analysis, the text analysis expert will find substantial new material in its pages. In particular, this collection describes developments in semantic and network text analysis methodologies that heretofore have been accessible only among a smattering of methodology journals. The book's international and cross-disciplinary content illustrates the breadth of quantitative text analysis applications. These applications demonstrate the methods' utility for international research, as well as for practitioners from the fields of sociology, political science, journalism/communication, computer science, marketing, education, and English. This is an \"ecumenical\" collection that contains applications not only of the most recent semantic and network text analysis methods, but also of the more traditional thematic method of text analysis. In fact, it is originally with this volume that these two \"relational\" approaches to text analysis are defined and contrasted with more traditional \"thematic\" text analysis methods. The emphasis here is on application. The book's chapters provide guidance regarding the sorts of inferences that each method affords, and up-to-date descriptions of the human and technological resources required to apply the methods. Its purpose is as a resource for making quantitative text analysis methods more accessible to social science researchers.",

The five goals included the following: (1) strengthen graduation requirements and provide a stronger curriculum; (2) adopt more rigorous and measurable standards and expectations; (3) devote more time to study the core curriculum; (4) enhance staff development and the teaching profession; and (5) provide effective leadership and adequate resources. Although school productivity is difficult to quantify, data indicate that progress is occurring for all categories of students. California has also been challenged by 100,000 new students that have entered schools annually since 1983, an increase in the number of limited-English speaking and economically disadvantaged students, and declines in funding. Twelve figures are included. (LMI)",

Cần học Prompt Engineering hiệu quả vì chất lượng đầu ra của các mô hình ngôn ngữ AI phụ thuộc nhiều vào chất lượng của các prompt. Prompt tốt có thể cải thiện đáng kể chất lượng đầu ra, trong khi prompt dở có thể tạo ra các kết quả không chính xác hoặc vô nghĩa. Cuốn sách này hướng dẫn tổng quan và thực tiễn về Prompt Engineering, tập trung vào các kỹ thuật và ứng dụng cho các mô hình ngôn ngữ AI. Phần mở đầu giới thiệu các kiến thức cơ bản về prompt, thảo luận về các yếu tố tạo nên một prompt hiệu quả và các kỹ thuật để tạo và tinh chỉnh prompt. Các phần sau đề cập tới các chủ đề nâng cao hơn như kết nối, tinh chỉnh và test prompt, cũng như các kỹ thuật chuyên sâu để xử lý sự thiên kiến (bias) hoặc nội dung nhạy cảm và cá nhân hóa prompt để phù hợp với từng người dùng. Các ví dụ thực tế được sử dụng để minh họa các khái niệm và các ứng dụng thực tế của prompt trong các chương của cuốn sách. Cuốn sách được thiết kế giúp việc học kiến thức trở nên thuận tiện, với mỗi chương xây dựng trên kiến thức được học từ chương trước.",

It selected the desert site in eastern Idaho on the Snake River Plain for its abundant supply of subsurface water and its relative isolation from densely populated settlements. The land already was in public ownership because the United States Navy had used it as a proving ground in connection with its Pocatello Ordnance Depot during World War II. The NRTS presently consists of about 890 square miles. Its name was changed to Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in 1974 and then to Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory in 1997. The business of NRTS was to experiment with and then accumulate and disseminate knowledge about nuclear reactors. One of the major goals of the United States Congress was to promote a commercial nuclear power industry. Much of the testing and experimentation at the NRTS was related to reactor safety and promoted this goal directly. Military application, although focused on weapon systems such as nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft bombers, were expected to generate knowledge and experience transferable to a commercial industry.",

This guide is designed to help directors of personnel and departmental pay and benefits managers implement the re-engineered process model developed by a team within the Treasury Board Secretariat. The model is designed to improve services to employees and managers, enhance the working environment of pay and benefits specialists, and reduce costs significantly. After an introductory section, chapter two presents the government's vision statement and guiding principles regarding pay and benefits services, defines client needs, and sets the goal of quality service. The next two chapters describe the state of pay and benefits today (the current process model) and the re-engineered process model (what pay and benefits will look like after change). The final two chapters contain information on implementing the future process model and managing change.",

        "description": "The authoritative introduction to all aspects of plastics engineering — offering both academic and industry perspectives in one complete volume. Introduction to Plastics Engineering provides a self-contained introduction to plastics engineering. A unique synergistic approach explores all aspects of material use — concepts, mechanics, materials, part design, part fabrication, and assembly — required for converting plastic materials, mainly in the form of small pellets, into useful products. Thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers, and advanced composites, the four disparate application areas of polymers normally treated as separate subjects, are covered together. Divided into five parts — Concepts, Mechanics, Materials, Part Processing and Assembly, and Material Systems — this inclusive volume enables readers to gain a well-rounded, foundational knowledge of plastics engineering. Chapters cover topics including the structure of polymers, how concepts from polymer physics explain the macro behavior of plastics, evolving concepts for plastics use, simple mechanics principles and their role in plastics engineering, models for the behavior of solids and fluids, and the mechanisms underlying the stiffening of plastics by embedded fibers. Drawing from his over fifty years in both academia and industry, Author Vijay Stokes uses the synergy between fundamentals and applications to provide a more meaningful introduction to plastics. Examines every facet of plastics engineering from materials and fabrication methods to advanced composites Provides accurate, up-to-date information for students and engineers both new to plastics and highly experienced with them Offers a practical guide to large number of materials and their applications Addresses current issues for mechanical design, part performance, and part fabrication Introduction to Plastics Engineering is an ideal text for practicing engineers, researchers, and students in mechanical and plastics engineering and related industries.",

What will the future require of engineers and how do we get there? This book seeks to answer these and many more questions. Engineering is not necessarily applied science or a subsection of the natural sciences - it could be a science in its own right. Becoming an engineer could involve much more than maths and physics - it could also involve a general understanding of the responsibilities towards society - and maybe a broader approach to engineering and technology would benefit the engineering sciences in general. The background for the present publication is a quest for a thorough analysis of engineering, engineering science, and engineering education. Focusing on the concepts of engineering science, skills, and Bildung, the book investigates the real challenges that are confronting engineering today, and discusses how to respond to these. Thereby, the book offers a complex and nuanced basis for debates on the actual status and the future directions of engineering science, engineering education, and the everyday practice of engineers."

        "description": "Real-world engineering problems are rarely, if ever, neatly divided into mechanical, electrical, chemical, civil, and other categories. Engineers from all disciplines eventually encounter computer and electronic controls and instrumentation, which require at least a basic knowledge of electrical and other engineering specialties, as well as associated economics, and environmental, political, and social issues. Co-authored by Charles Gross—one of the most well-known and respected professors in the field of electric machines and power engineering—and his world-renowned colleague Thad Roppel, Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering provides an overview of the profession for engineering professionals and students whose specialization lies in areas other than electrical. For instance, civil engineers must contend with commercial electrical service and lighting design issues. Mechanical engineers have to deal with motors in HVAC applications, and chemical engineers are forced to handle problems involving process control. Simple and easy-to-use, yet more than sufficient in rigor and coverage of fundamental concepts, this resource teaches EE fundamentals but omits the typical analytical methods that hold little relevance for the audience. The authors provide many examples to illustrate concepts, as well as homework problems to help readers understand and apply presented material. In many cases, courses for non-electrical engineers, or non-EEs, have presented watered-down classical EE material, resulting in unpopular courses that students hate and senior faculty members understandingly avoid teaching. To remedy this situation—and create more well-rounded practitioners—the authors focus on the true EE needs of non-EEs, as determined through their own teaching experience, as well as significant input from non-EE faculty. The book provides several important contemporary interdisciplinary examples to support this approach. The result is a full-color modern narrative that bridges the various EE and non-EE curricula and serves as a truly relevant course that students and faculty can both enjoy.",

These are benefits we often just take for granted. But at the same time, as these products disburden us of unwanted tasks that consumed much time and effort in earlier eras, many of them also leave us more disengaged from our natural and even human surroundings. It is the task of what Gene Moriarty calls focal engineering to create products that will achieve a balance between disburdenment and engagement: &“How much disburdenment will be appropriate while still permitting an engagement that enriches one&’s life, elevates the spirit, and calls forth a good life in a convivial society?&” One of his examples of a focally engineered structure is the Golden Gate Bridge, which &“draws people to it, enlivens and elevates the human spirit, and resonates with the world of its congenial setting. Humans, bridge, and world are in tune.&” These values of engagement, enlivenment, and resonance are key to the normative approach Moriarty brings to the profession of engineering, which traditionally has focused mainly on technical measures of evaluation such as efficiency, productivity, objectivity, and precision. These measures, while important, look at the engineered product in a local and limited sense. But &“from a broader perspective, what is locally benign may present serious moral problems,&” undermining &“social justice, environmental sustainability, and health and safety of affected parties.&” It is this broader perspective that is championed by focal engineering, the subject of Part III of the book, which Moriarty contrasts with &“modern&” engineering in Part I and &“pre-modern&” engineering in Part II.",

The Routledge Handbook of the Philosophy of Engineering presents the state-of-the-art of this field and lays a foundation for shaping future conversations within it. With a broad scholarly scope and 55 chapters contributed by both established experts and fresh voices in the field, the Handbook provides valuable insights into this dynamic and fast-growing field. The volume focuses on central issues and debates, established themes, and new developments in: Foundational perspectives Engineering reasoning Ontology Engineering design processes Engineering activities and methods Values in engineering Responsibilities in engineering practice Reimagining engineering The Routledge Handbook of the Philosophy of Engineering will be of value for both students and active researchers in philosophy of engineering and in cognate fields (philosophy of technology, philosophy of design). It is also intended for engineers working both inside and outside of academia who would like to gain a more fundamental understanding of their particular professional field. The increasing development of new technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, and new interdisciplinary fields, such as human-computer interaction, calls not only for philosophical inquiry but also for engineers and philosophers to work in collaboration with one another. At the same time, the demands on engineers to respond to the challenges of world health, climate change, poverty, and other so-called \"wicked problems\" have also been on the rise. These factors, together with the fact that a host of questions concerning the processes by which technologies are developed have arisen, make the current Handbook a timely and valuable publication.",

        "description": "Mathematical Programming has been of significant interest and relevance in engineering, an area that is very rich in challenging optimization problems. In particular, many design and operational problems give rise to nonlinear and mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems whose modeling and solu tion is often nontrivial. Furthermore, with the increased computational power and development of advanced analysis (e. g. , process simulators, finite element packages) and modeling systems (e. g. , GAMS, AMPL, SPEEDUP, ASCEND, gPROMS), the size and complexity of engineering optimization models is rapidly increasing. While the application of efficient local solvers (nonlinear program ming algorithms) has become widespread, a major limitation is that there is often no guarantee that the solutions that are generated correspond to global optima. In some cases finding a local solution might be adequate, but in others it might mean incurring a significant cost penalty, or even worse, getting an incorrect solution to a physical problem. Thus, the need for finding global optima in engineering is a very real one. It is the purpose of this monograph to present recent developments of tech niques and applications of deterministic approaches to global optimization in engineering. The present monograph is heavily represented by chemical engi neers; and to a large extent this is no accident. The reason is that mathematical programming is an active and vibrant area of research in chemical engineering. This trend has existed for about 15 years.",

Different engineering disciplines, such as mechanical, materials, computer and process engineering, provide the foundation for the design and development of improved structures, materials and processes. The modern design cycle is characterized by the interaction between various disciplines and a strong shift to computer-based approaches where only a few experiments are conducted for verification purposes. A major driver for this development is the increased demand for cost reduction, which is also linked to environmental demands. In the transportation industry (e.g. automotive or aerospace), the demand for higher fuel efficiency is related to reduced operational costs and less environmental damage. One way to fulfil such requirements is lighter structures and/or improved processes for energy conversion. Another emerging area is the interaction of classical engineering with the health and medical sector.",

Ethical codes, which govern the behavior of engineers, are examined from a historical perspective linking the prevailing codes to models of the natural world. A new ethical code based on a recently introduced model of Nature as an integral community is provided and discussed. Applications of the new code are described using a case study approach. With the ethical code based on an integral community in place, new design algorithms are developed and also explored using case studies. Implications of the proposed changes in ethics and design on engineering education are considered.

It investigates the ranking aggregation problem and the related features, such as input/output data, simplification hypotheses, importance hierarchy of experts. In addition to a well-structured overview of several interesting, consolidated methodological approaches, it presents innovative approaches that can also be applied profitably in other fields. The fascinating selection of topics included is based on research that has been developed in the past twenty years. The descriptions are supported by figures, tables, flowcharts, diagrams, examples and practical case studies. The book is an ideal resource for engineering academics, practitioners, technicians and students, who do not necessarily have an in-depth knowledge of decision-making. It is also a thought-provoking read for engineers and academics looking for innovative ways to improve engineering processes in a variety of fields, such as conceptual design, quality improvement, reliability engineering. “Today, rankings are exercised in all spheres of life, products are ranked on Amazon and similar platforms; services such as restaurants and hotels on platforms such as TripAdvisor; and other services such as lectures or even medical treatment on different specialized platforms. We often make our daily decisions based on these rankings. The quality of our decisions depends on our ability to select appropriate methods to fit the context and needs. We need to be familiar with the theory and practice of these methods to make them useful. To this purpose, this book is an important addition to the bookshelves of academics and professionals, not only from engineering. The connection between theory and practice is weaved throughout the book, making it useful for practitioners also.” Prof. Yoram Reich, Full Professor and Head of Systems Engineering research Initiative at Tel Aviv University (Israel), Editor-in-Chief of “Research in Engineering Design”",

It is both a creative process not easily defined and a thought process that can, with increasing success, be externalized, articulated, and modelled. This book aims to clarify the issues, providing an operational definition of engineering design and an explication of design as a discipline. In particular, the book focuses on the contribution of AI (artificial intelligence) to engineering design. With its clear presentation of the main ideas of recent AI-based models of design, set within the context of inductive design models, the book offers an integrated view of current thinking about design. Also included is a brief review of some key AI-based problem-solving methods and classical design tools. The author closes with a look ahead at the roles that symbolic representation and knowledge-based (expert) systems can play in engineering design in practice and in education.",

Recent advances in science and technology have made it possible to seamlessly connect and integrate various elements of engineering systems, and opened the door for innovations that have transformed how we live and work. While these developments have yielded enhanced efficiency and numerous improvements in our current practices, the problems caused by the increased complexity of these integrated systems can be extremely difficult. Accordingly, solving these problems involves applying cross-disciplinary expertise to address the heterogeneity of the various elements inherent in the system. These proceedings address four main themes: (I) Smart and Sustainable Construction, (II) Advances in Project Management Practices, (III) Toward Safety and Productivity Improvement, and (IV) Smart Manufacturing, Design, and Logistics. As such, they will be of interest to and valuable to researchers and practitioners in a range of industries seeking an update on the translational fields of engineering, project, and production management.",

        "description": "The new edition of Garber and Hoel's best-selling TRAFFIC AND HIGHWAY ENGINEERING focuses on giving students insight into all facets of traffic and highway engineering. Students generally come to this course with little knowledge or understanding of the importance of transportation, much less of the extensive career opportunities within the field. Transportation is an extremely broad field, and courses must either cover all transportation modes or focus on specifics. While many topics can be covered with a survey approach, this often lacks sufficient depth and students leave the course without a full understanding of any of the fields. This text focuses exclusively on traffic and highway engineering beginning with a discussion of the pivotal role transportation plays in our society, including employment opportunities, historical impact, and the impact of transportation on our daily lives. This approach gives students a sense of what the field is about as well as an opportunity to consider some of its challenges. Later chapters focus on specific issues facing transportation engineers. The text uses pedagogical tools such as worked problems, diagrams and tables, reference material, and realistic examples to demonstrate how the material is applied.

The aim of this workshop was to bring together researchers and scientists, businessmen and entrepreneurs, teachers, engineers, computer users, and students to discuss the numerous fields of computer science and to share their experiences and exchange new ideas and information in a meaningful way. Research results about all aspects (theory, applications and tools) of computer and information science, and to discuss the practical challenges encountered along the way and the solutions adopted to solve them. The workshop organizers selected the best papers from those papers accepted for presentation at the workshop. The papers were chosen based on review scores submitted by members of the program committee and underwent further rigorous rounds of review. From this second round of review, 17 of the conference’s most promising papers are then published in this Springer (SCI) book and not the conference proceedings. We impatiently await the important contributions that we know these authors will bring to the field of computer and information science.",

The Institute was held in the Department of Civil Engineering at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, from June 25th to July 6th 1989. Both volumes reflect the full range of the systems approach to civil and structural engineering problems including: structural analysis and design; water resources engineering; geotechnical engineering; transportation and environmental engineering. This system approach, discussed in the first volume, includes a number of common threads: mathematical programming, game theory, utility theory, statistical decision theory, networks, and fuzzy logic. A most important feature of this volume is the examination of similar representations of different civil engineering problems and their solutions using general systems approaches. The decision support aspect of the institute is reflected in the second volume by the knowledge-based systems and their artificial intelligence approach. Papers discussing many aspects of knowledge-based systems in civil and structural engineering are included in the second volume."

Emphasis is placed on identifying service requirements and how materials relate to those requirements, rather than listing materials and describing applications. This edition has been revised throughout and now includes coverage of the use of new materials in engineering, materials for bearings and tribological usage, and the use of materials in civil engineering structures. It has also been expanded to include more case studies and worked examples in order to provide tangible and interactive contact with the content matter. The book also contains a detailed consideration of the weldability of steels, the welding of plastics and adhesion. programmes. An example of this development is the inclusion of a chapter detailing the use of materials in automobile structures; a field in which the traditional use of steel is being displaced as the application of reinforced polymers becomes more widespread. The book also reflects the growing use of computerized databases and materials selection programmes. Core subject area for all Engineering and Materials degrees Complementary to Materials Selection in Mechanical Design (Ashby) Includes Case Studies and Worked Examples",

        "description": "Excerpt from Heavy Electrical Engineering Many text books have been published under the general title of \"Electrical Engineering.\" An examination of these books reveals on the part of their authors a conception of the preferential scope of the subject which is at complete variance with my conception. Hence, beyond the similarity of title, there is nothing in common between the present treatise and these others. I have omitted routine descriptive material as well as the elementary generalities regarding electricity and magnetism, and I have directed my efforts to an attempt to familiarize the reader with various considerations and calculations of which a sound, knowledge should be acquired in order to enable him effectively to engage in practical electrical engineering work. Regrettable as it appears, it is nevertheless a fact that the real progress in electrical engineering is being made by too small a majority of those engaged in the electrical engineering profession. Many have not the remotest approach to broad knowledge of the subject; often they have not the energy or the enterprise to exercise their own reasoning faculties. Such are hardly more than figure-heads desirous on the one hand of being on the side of the most fashionable engineering fad, so soon as there is no longer any doubt of its being fashionable, and on the other hand hesitating to depart from the cut-and-dried practice of years standing, which makes the preparation of plans a mere matter of copying, and eliminates all risk and uncertainty. Swayed by these opposing tendencies, they soon become incapable of seeing any engineering question in its true aspects.

First, readers are introduced to the core concepts of the object-oriented methodology, which is used throughout the book to act as the foundation for software engineering and programming practices, and partly for the software engineering process itself. Then, the processes involved in software engineering are explained in more detail, especially methods and their applications in design, implementation, testing, and measurement, as they relate to software engineering projects. At last, readers are given the chance to practice these concepts by applying commonly used skills and tasks to a hands-on project. The impact of such a format is the potential for quicker and deeper understanding. Readers will master concepts and skills at the most basic levels before continuing to expand on and apply these lessons in later chapters.",

        "description": "The Boundary Element Method (BEM) has been established as a powerful numerical tool for the analysis of continua in recent years. The method is based on an attempt to transfer the governing differential equations into integral equations over the boundary. Thus, the discretization scheme or the intro duction of any approximations must be done over the boundary. This book presents a BEM for two-dimensional elastic, thermo -elastic and body-force contact problems. The formulation is implemented for the general case of contact with various fric tional conditions. The analysis is limited to linear elasto statics and small strain theory. Following a review of the basic nature of contact problems, the analytical basis of the direct formulation of the BEM method is described. The numerical implementation employs three-noded isoparametric line elements for the representa tion of the boundary of the bodies in contact. Opposite nodal points in equi-Iength element-pairs are defined on the two surfaces in the area which is expected to come into contact under an increasing load. The use of appropriate contact IV conditions enables the integral equations for the two bodies to be coupled together. To find the proper contact dimensions and the contact load a combined incremental and iterative approach is utilised. With this approach, the loads are applied progressively, and the sliding and adhering portion of the contact region is established for each load increment using an iterative procedure. A coulomb type of friction law is assumed.",

        "description": "America is changing. Many of the most noticeable changes in day-to-day life are associated with the advancing capabilities of computer systems, the growing variety of tasks they can accomplish, and the accelerating rate of change. Advanced engineering environments (AEEs) combine advanced, networked computer systems with advanced modeling and simulation technologies. When more fully developed, AEEs will enable teams of researchers, technologists, designers, manufacturers, suppliers, customers, and other users scattered across a continent or the globe to develop new products and carry out new missions with unprecedented effectiveness. Business as usual, however, will not achieve this vision. Government, industry, and academic organizations need to make the organizational and process changes that will enable their staffs to use current and future AEE technologies and systems. Design in the New Millennium: Advanced Engineering Environments: Phase 2 is the second part of a two-part study of advanced engineering environments. The Phase 1 report, issued in 1999, identified steps the federal government, industry, and academia could take in the near term to enhance the development of AEE technologies and systems with broad application in the U.S. engineering enterprise. Design in the New Millennium focuses on the long-term potential of AEE technologies and systems over the next 15 years. This report calls on government, industry, and academia to make major changes to current organizational cultures and practices to achieve a long-term vision that goes far beyond what current capabilities allow.",

        "description": "Consumer expectations are systematically growing, with demands for foods with a number of attributes, which are sometimes difficult for manufacturers to meet. The engineering processes that are needed to obtain top-quality foods are a major challenge due to the diversity of raw materials, intermediates, and final products. As in any other enterprise, the food industry must optimize each of the steps in the production chain to attain the best possible results. There is no question that a very important aspect to take into consideration when developing a process, designing a food factory, or modifying existing facilities is the in-depth knowledge of the basic engineering aspects involved in a given project. Introduction to Food Process Engineering covers the fundamental principles necessary to study, understand, and analyze most unit operations in the food engineering domain. It was conceived with two clear objectives in mind: 1) to present all of the subjects in a systematic, coherent, and sequential fashion in order to provide an excellent knowledge base for a number of conventional and unconventional processes encountered in food industry processing lines, as well as novel processes at the research and development stages; 2) to be the best grounding possible for another CRC Press publication, Unit Operations in Food Engineering, Second Edition, by the same authors. These two books can be consulted independently, but at the same time, there is a significant and welcomed match between the two in terms of terminology, definitions, units, symbols, and nomenclature. Highlights of the book include: Dimensional analysis and similarities Physicochemistry of food systems Heat and mass transfer in food Food rheology Physical properties Water activity Thermal processing Chilling and freezing Evaporation Dehydration Extensive examples, problems, and solutions",
